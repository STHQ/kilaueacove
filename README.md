# Lava Lounge

This repository relates to my screening room (home theater) called the Lava Lounge, plus the Tiki Nook, just outside the Lava Lounge's door, where there is a drinks cart and shelves with tiki mugs.

The purpose is to collect all of my code, wiring diagrams, graphical elements, and setup instructions for the lighting, effects, and other electronics in the space — not only for my own use (if/when we move and I have to piece it all back together again), but as a reference for anyone else who plans to build interactive lights and effects for a small space.

More discussion of these elements as I create or update them can be found on my blog, under the [Lava Lounge](http://stationinthemetro.com/tag/lava-lounge) and [Tiki Nook](http://stationinthemetro.com/tag/tiki-nook) tags.
