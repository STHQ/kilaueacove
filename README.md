# Kilauea Cove

> [As featured on Critiki!](https://news.critiki.com/2017/04/25/how-to-build-a-volcano-raspberry-pi-style/) Thanks, Humuhumu!

This repository relates to my screening room (home theater), the bar area, and the “tiki took,” just outside the screening room’s door, where there is a drinks cart, and shelves with tiki mugs and other barware. Collectively, this is **[Kilauea Cove](https://critiki.com/location/kilauea-cove-seattle-1005/)**.

The purpose is to collect all of my code, wiring diagrams, graphical elements, and setup instructions for the lighting, effects, and other electronics in the space — not only for my own use (if/when we move and I have to piece it back together again), but as a reference for anyone else who plans to build interactive lights and effects for a small space.

I did a [full write-up on my Vixen Labs website](https://vixenlabs.com/2017/02/18/kilauea-cove-raspberry-pi-active-volcano/), with information about how I built the whole Cove space. I have also posted work-in-progress photos and commentary to a thread on [Tiki Central](http://www.tikiroom.com/tikicentral/bb/viewtopic.php?topic=51211&forum=20&25), though that is a bit out of date.

As I update further versions of this project, you'll find posts under the [Kilauea Cove](https://vixenlabs.com/project/kilauea-cove/) tag on Vixen Labs.

## The Name

**Q:** Why “Kilauea Cove”?

**A:** The most direct references are [Kilauea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kīlauea), the most active volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, which ties in to what I hope will be a very active Volcano Show. *Cove* can be defined as “[a recessed place](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cove),” which describes the Tiki Nook very well. Of course, the alternate water-related meaning of *cove*, and the reference to [one of my favorite surf rock bands](http://www.kilaueas.de), only add to the enjoyment.

Plus, y’know, alliteration is pretty fun.

**Q:** Wasn't this called “Lava Lounge” before?

**A:** Yes. However, the old name, “Lava Lounge,” unintentionally duplicated the name of [a Seattle bar](https://critiki.com/location/lava-lounge-seattle-173/). To reduce possible confusion (since I am *also* in Seattle), and to give my space a unique\* name globally, *Kilauea Cove* is the new name.

<sub>\*The only other Kilauea Cove I could find, by searching online, is the name of a pair of water slides at [Big Surf Water Park](http://bigsurffun.com/rides/) in Tempe, AZ.</sub>
