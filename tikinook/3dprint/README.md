## Kilauea Smoke Mount

v04

This is a 3D-printable mount for a smoke generator, made to fit inside a tiki mug. The mount was designed in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org), and included here are the current OpenSCAD file (for editing) and Stereo Lithography (STL) file for printing, as well as an image preview render.

### Compatibility

- [Seuthe #5 smoke generator](http://www.gaugemaster.com/item_details.asp?code=SEUTHE%20NO5&r=1) (for model trains / buildings, 4.5-6V, 260mA)
- Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar, [Krakatoa mug](http://www.ooga-mooga.com/cgi-bin/all/mug.cgi?mode=view&mug_id=7021)
- [NeoPixel Ring - 24 x 5050 RGB LED with Integrated Drivers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1586)

### Concept
Mount to hold the smoke generator upright inside the base of the tiki mug, with a NeoPixel (LED) ring mount at the top.

### TODO

- Add a ring at the top that I can mount the NeoPixels LED ring to directly

### Version History

- v04
    - Remove “smoke collection hat” that did more harm than good.
    - Left the stems that supported the hat, as a makeshift handle to seat/remove the stand inside the mug.
- v03
    - Added a second small ring to hold the smoke generator more securely and keep it from tipping.
- v02
    - Added smoke “hat”. The idea was to spread the smoke out over a wider area to give the illusion of a larger smoke source. This did not work.
- v01
    - Base ring and small ring for generator only.
